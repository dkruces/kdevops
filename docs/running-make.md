# Running make

After you configuration you to just run:

```
make
```

If this is your first run and you enabled `CONFIG_KDEVOPS_FIRST_RUN` then
some more things will be done for you as documented in
[kdevops first run](kdevops-first-run.md).

You should however disable `CONFIG_KDEVOPS_FIRST_RUN` after you first run.

Running `make` will do a few more things:

  * Reads you .config and based on this generate an equivalent yaml file to
    be used by Ansible moving forward. The file is `extra_vars.yaml`. You
    can always just remove this file, and run `make extra_vars.yaml`
    if you want to regenerate the file.

    At any point in time it is perfectly safe to:

```bash
rm -f extra_vars.yaml
make extra_vars.yaml
```

  * Generates the top level ansible host file

    At any point in time it is perfectly safe to:

```bash
rm -f hosts
make hosts
```

  * If using virtualization it will generate the dynamic Vagrant and vagrant
    nodes file, `kdevops_nodes.yaml`.

    It is *not* safe to destroy the Vagrantfile if you have done a git fetch
    and reset for kdevops, given that vagrant requires you to never modify
    your Vagrantfile *after* you have instantiated guests. kdevops provides
    a guard file for you so you don't shoot yourself in the foot and make
    commands won't regenerate the file for you unless you remove this guard.

    The files in question is `vagrant/Vagrantfile`. The respective configuration
    for the nodes, `vagrant/kdevops_nodes.yaml` should not be updated either,
    because the Vagrantfile relies on it.
