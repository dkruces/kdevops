# Concurrent Architecture Demo - Validation Guide

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive validation procedures for the concurrent architecture demo workflow. The demo showcases the single checkout + dynamic symlink approach that solves GitHub Actions concurrency limitations.

## Demo Components

### Workflow: `concurrent-demo.yml`
- **Location**: `.github/workflows/concurrent-demo.yml`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates concurrent-safe workflow execution
- **Triggers**: 
  - Push to `ci-wip` branch (automatic)
  - Manual dispatch with configurable parameters

### Action: `concurrent-demo`
- **Location**: `.github/actions/concurrent-demo/action.yml`  
- **Purpose**: Multi-phase action showcasing isolated execution
- **Phases**: setup, test, cleanup

## Architecture Validation

### Core Concepts Demonstrated

#### 1. Single Checkout + Dynamic Symlink
```yaml
# Single checkout to isolated directory
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    path: ${{ env.WORK_DIR }}  # e.g., demo-17990251359
    clean: true

# Dynamic symlink before each action
- run: ln -sf "${{ env.WORK_DIR }}/.github/actions" ./actions
- uses: ./actions/concurrent-demo
```

#### 2. True Run Isolation
- Each workflow run gets unique directory: `{demo_name}-{run_id}`
- Example: `demo-17990251359`, `fstests-17990251360`
- No interference between concurrent runs

#### 3. Race Condition Handling  
- Symlink updated before each action step
- Handles concurrent runner scenarios gracefully
- Each action uses correct files regardless of interference

## Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Single Workflow Execution

#### Procedure
1. Navigate to GitHub repository
2. Go to Actions → Concurrent Architecture Demo
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Set parameters:
   - `demo_name`: `test-single`  
   - `test_concurrent`: `false`
5. Click "Run workflow"

#### Expected Results
- ✅ Workflow completes successfully
- ✅ All three phases (setup, test, cleanup) execute
- ✅ Symlink updates work correctly  
- ✅ Directory isolation maintained
- ✅ kdevops structure validation passes
- ✅ Results archived successfully

#### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Workflow status: Success
- [ ] Setup phase: Creates config files and demo directories
- [ ] Test phase: Validates isolation and generates results  
- [ ] Cleanup phase: Archives results and cleans up
- [ ] No broken pipe errors in logs
- [ ] Work directory contains expected files

### Test 2: Concurrent Workflow Execution

#### Procedure
1. **First workflow**:
   - Run workflow with `demo_name`: `concurrent-1`
   - Set `test_concurrent`: `true`
   - Do NOT wait for completion
   
2. **Second workflow** (start immediately):
   - Run workflow with `demo_name`: `concurrent-2`  
   - Set `test_concurrent`: `true`
   - Do NOT wait for completion

3. **Third workflow** (start immediately):
   - Run workflow with `demo_name`: `concurrent-3`
   - Set `test_concurrent`: `true`

#### Expected Results
- ✅ All three workflows run simultaneously  
- ✅ Each maintains separate work directories
- ✅ Symlink updates handle race conditions
- ✅ No workflow interferes with others
- ✅ All complete successfully
- ✅ Lock files demonstrate isolation

#### Validation Checklist  
- [ ] All workflows show "Success" status
- [ ] Each has unique work directory in logs
- [ ] Symlink race conditions handled gracefully
- [ ] Lock file mechanism works correctly
- [ ] No cross-workflow contamination
- [ ] Concurrent behavior test reports expected behavior

### Test 3: Resource Cleanup Validation

#### Procedure
1. Run multiple workflows with different demo names
2. Wait for all to complete
3. Check runner for leftover directories
4. Verify cleanup mechanism effectiveness

#### Expected Results
- ✅ Completed workflows clean up their lock files
- ✅ Work directories remain for result inspection
- ✅ No accumulated temporary files
- ✅ Archive directories created in workspace

#### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Lock files removed after workflow completion
- [ ] Work directories contain expected results
- [ ] Archive directories accessible
- [ ] No unexpected file accumulation

## Validation Criteria

### Success Indicators

#### Workflow Level
1. **Green Status**: All workflows complete with success status
2. **Phase Completion**: Setup → Test → Cleanup sequence works
3. **Error Handling**: Cleanup runs even if earlier phases fail
4. **Timing**: Completes within reasonable time (< 5 minutes)

#### Architecture Level  
1. **Isolation**: Each run operates in separate directory
2. **Concurrency**: Multiple runs execute without interference
3. **Consistency**: Symlink mechanism handles race conditions
4. **Cleanup**: Resources properly cleaned after execution

#### Integration Level
1. **kdevops Compatibility**: Works with kdevops Makefile structure
2. **Action Discovery**: Static action paths work correctly  
3. **Parameter Passing**: work_dir parameter flows through layers
4. **Result Archival**: Output preserved for inspection

### Failure Indicators

#### Critical Failures (Must Fix)
- ❌ Workflow fails with error status
- ❌ Actions not found due to symlink issues  
- ❌ Directory conflicts between concurrent runs
- ❌ Work directory isolation breached

#### Warning Signs (Monitor)
- ⚠️ Symlink warnings in concurrent tests (expected)
- ⚠️ Make help test warnings (non-fatal)
- ⚠️ Resource cleanup delays
- ⚠️ Performance degradation

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Can't find action.yml"
**Cause**: Symlink not updated before action step
**Solution**: Verify symlink update steps run before each action

#### Issue: Directory not found
**Cause**: Checkout failed or incorrect work_dir reference  
**Solution**: Check checkout step and environment variable consistency

#### Issue: Concurrent workflows interfere
**Cause**: Insufficient isolation or shared resources
**Solution**: Verify unique work directory creation and symlink updates

#### Issue: Broken pipe errors
**Cause**: Piping make help through head or other commands  
**Solution**: Use direct make commands or redirect output properly

### Debug Information

#### Key Log Sections
1. **Checkout Verification**: Confirms isolated directory creation
2. **Symlink Updates**: Shows race condition handling
3. **Phase Execution**: Demonstrates isolated operations  
4. **Concurrent Testing**: Validates multi-run behavior

#### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check work directories on runner
ls -la *-[0-9]*

# Verify symlink status  
readlink ./actions

# Check for lock files
ls -la /tmp/demo-lock-*

# Inspect results
cat demo-archive-*/test-results.json
```

## Performance Expectations

### Baseline Metrics
- **Single workflow**: 2-4 minutes
- **Concurrent workflows**: 2-4 minutes each  
- **Checkout time**: 10-30 seconds
- **Phase execution**: 30-60 seconds each

### Scaling Characteristics
- **Concurrent runs**: Limited by runner capacity, not architecture
- **Disk usage**: ~100MB per work directory  
- **Memory usage**: Standard GitHub Actions overhead
- **Network**: Single checkout per run (efficient)

## Next Steps

### After Successful Validation
1. **Document Results**: Update this guide with actual test results
2. **Begin Phase 2**: Start migrating core workflows using demo patterns
3. **Create Templates**: Extract reusable patterns from demo
4. **Train Team**: Ensure understanding of new architecture

### If Validation Fails
