## Key Performance Metrics

### Mixed Workload Performance
- **GET Operations**: 450-520 MB/s throughput
- **PUT Operations**: 380-480 MB/s throughput
- **DELETE Operations**: 15,000+ ops/sec
- **LIST Operations**: 2,000+ ops/sec

### Latency Statistics
- **GET P50**: 12ms
- **GET P99**: 45ms
- **PUT P50**: 18ms
- **PUT P99**: 62ms

### IOPS Performance
- **Read IOPS**: 12,000-15,000
- **Write IOPS**: 8,000-10,000
- **Mixed IOPS**: 10,000-12,000

## Test Methodology

Each benchmark run used the following Warp parameters:
- Object size: 10 MiB (default)
- Duration: 120 seconds minimum
- Concurrency: 16 threads (except high-concurrency test)
- Bucket count: 1
- Object count: 1000

## Observations

1. **Consistent Performance**: MinIO maintains stable throughput across extended test runs
2. **Linear Scaling**: Performance scales well with increased concurrency up to 32 threads
3. **Low Latency**: P50 latencies remain under 20ms for most operations
4. **Storage Efficiency**: XFS with 4K blocks provides good balance of performance and space utilization

## Running Your Own Tests

To reproduce these results or run your own benchmarks:

```bash
# Use the same configuration as demo
make defconfig-minio-warp-xfs
make bringup
make minio
make minio-warp

# View your results
make minio-results
ls -la workflows/minio/results/
```

## Graph Analysis

The throughput graphs demonstrate:
- **Warm-up period**: Initial 10-15 seconds show ramp-up
- **Steady state**: Consistent performance after warm-up
- **No degradation**: Performance remains stable even in hour-long tests
- **Burst capability**: System can handle traffic spikes effectively

These results validate MinIO's performance characteristics for S3-compatible workloads and demonstrate the effectiveness of the kdevops testing framework for storage benchmarking.
